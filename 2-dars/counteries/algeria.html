            <h1>Algeria</h1>
            <p>Algeria,officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in North Africa. Algeria
                is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the
                southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the
                Mediterranean Sea. It is considered part of the Maghreb region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid
                geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the
                geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it
                the world's tenth largest nation by area, and the largest nation in Africa, more than 200 times as large
                as the continent's smallest country, The Gambia. With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the
                tenth-most populous country in Africa, and the 32nd-most populous country in the world. The capital and
                largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.</p>
