            <p>Albania , officially the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Republika e Shqipërisë),is a country in
                Southeast Europe. The country is located in the Balkans on the Adriatic and Ionian Seas within the
                Mediterranean Sea and shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast,
                North Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south. Spanning an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi), it

                country's landscapes range from
                rugged snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps and the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian
                Mountains, to fertile lowland plains extending from the coasts of the Adriatic and Ionian seas. Tirana
