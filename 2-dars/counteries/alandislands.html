            <h1>Åland Islands</h1>
            <p>Åland (Swedish: Finnish: Ahvenanmaa) is an autonomous and demilitarised region of Finland.
                Receiving its autonomy by a 1920 decision of the League of Nations, it is the smallest region of
                Finland by both area (1,580 km2) and population (30,129), constituting 0.51% of Finland's land area and
                0.54% of its population. Its only official language is Swedish and the capital city is Mariehamn.</p>
